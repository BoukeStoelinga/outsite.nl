      OUTcamp is the committee that organises the spectacular yearly camp for Outsite. The camp is a good introduction
      for new members, but also a lot of fun for people who’ve been to Outsite before. The last few year we’ve had quite
      some fun themes like: “let it gay!” and “holigay twist”. The camp is always a party with campfires, games and lots
      and lots of wine!

      InsideOUT is the committee that makes sure there is plenty to do at Outsite. They do theme drinks, christmas
      dinners, Sinterklaas, karaoke and much more! Basically every not-normal drink, except for the legendary OUTnights
      of course! This is a very approachable committee to do as a first committee.

      The Coming Out Day (COD) Committee organises the most colourful day of the year: Coming Out Day! This day, which
      is celebrated every year on the 11th of October, is so much more than an opportunity to come out of the closet.
      It is a day of raising awareness, creating visibility and of course: celebration. You are given a lot of freedom
      (and budget) to organise something in this context. In the past years, the COD committee has organised activities
      ranging from big parties with live music to (pride) parades and poster expositions. Often, multiple activities are
      even combined to form a complete day of outness joy. Outsite plays a big role in these festivities of course but
      the committee also makes sure that the general and student population of Delft are being involved as much as
      possible. Happy coming out day!

    name: 'OUTnight',
    description: `
      Each year Outsite organises 3 to 4 Queer dancing parties at our bar. These parties are made possible by the
      OUTnight Committee. Each party has its own theme, such as 2HOT 🔥, Queen's Casino 🎭, SurReal 👁, Out in Space 🪐,
      Crushing Cupid 💘 and RAWR: Unleash the Animals 🐍. The committee is responsible for coming up with the theme,
      fancy cocktails, decorations, arranging a DJ, etc. There usually is a photobooth at the party as well and there
      has even been live music once. It’s super fun to work with this committee and create a fabulous night that
      attracts members and regular visitors as well as new people and are very fun nights!

      The OWee committee ensures that the introduction week in Delft runs smoothly every year. This committee is super
      fun and close because it is a big task that you live up to very much. If you have all this cool events in the
      OWee such as parties, escape rooms and gay bingo, it gives a very good feeling when new students enjoy this and
      maybe join Outsite :)
