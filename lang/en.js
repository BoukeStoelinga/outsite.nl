      activities, ranging from drinks every Thursday night and quarterly LGBT+ parties to trips to other cities where
      we go out together. Outsite is a part of<a href="https://www.dwhdelft.nl" class="text-pink-400">DWH</a>, the LGBT+
      association of Delft. <br>
      <br>
      These activities are all organized by our fantastic committees and members! The best way to become acquainted with
      Outsite is to take part in the introduction groups (which we call KMGs) or through the use of the bar buddy
      system: Where we will make sure there is someone ready to show you around and who could introduce you to others.`,
